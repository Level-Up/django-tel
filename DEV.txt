If django-tel comes close to meeting a need of yours but falls short,
please let me know.  You can send email about django-tel to
amax@hilomath.com.  Quality patches are appreciated and accepted,
especially if they include unit tests.  Existing unit tests are in
src/tel/tests.py.

Speaking of tests:  The easiest way to run tests is with nosetests
[0].  Before they will run, you will need to set up your python path,
and point to testsettings.py as the Django settings module.  For
example, here is how I do it on my local machine:

{{{
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src:$HOME/src/Django-1.1/:$PYTHONPATH
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=testsettings
}}}
