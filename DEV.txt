If django-tel comes close to meeting a need of yours but falls short,
please let me know.  You can send email about django-tel to
amax@mobilewebup.com.  Quality patches are appreciated and accepted,
especially if they include unit tests.  Existing unit tests are in
src/tel/tests.py.

Speaking of tests: An easy way to run django-tel's tests is with
nosetests [0].  Before they will run, you will need to set up your
python path, and point to testsettings.py as the Django settings
module.  For example, here is how I do it on my local machine:

{{{
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src:$HOME/src/Django-1.2/:$PYTHONPATH
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=testsettings
}}}

After that, simply executing "nosetests" with no arguments will find
and run all tests.
